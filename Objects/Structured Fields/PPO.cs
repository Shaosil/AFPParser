Such preprocessing may involve a rasterization or RIP of the object, but is not limited to that. The resource is identified with a file name, the identifier of a begin structured field for the resource, or any other identifier associated with the resource. The referenced resource and all required secondary resources must previously have been mapped with an MDR or an MPO in the same environment group.  Preprocessing is not supported for objects that are included with structures that are outside the document. Examples of such objects are medium overlays and PMC overlays, both of which are included with structures in the form map.";
